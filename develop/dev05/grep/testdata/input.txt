Overview
Package regexp implements regular expression search.

The syntax of the regular 
expressions accepted is the
same general syntax used by Perl,
Python,
and other languages.
More precisely,
it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at https://golang.org/s/re2syntax, 
except for \C. For an overview of the syntax, see the regexp/syntax package.

The regexp implementation provided by this package 
is guaranteed to run in time linear in the size of the input. 
(This is a property not guaranteed by most open source implementations of regular expressions.) 
For more information about this property, see

or any book    about automata theory.

All characters are UTF-8-encoded code points. Following utf8.DecodeRune,
each byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence is treated as 
if it encoded utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD).

There are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular
expression and identify the matched text.
Their names are matched by this regular expression:
